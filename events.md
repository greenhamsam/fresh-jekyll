## Workshops

_These costs are indicative, and I reserve the right to change them at any time._

### 90 Minute Intro to Money Management
A fast, funny talk that aims to provoke you to think about money management. Normal cost is between **R5,000 - R10,000** depending on where in the country you want me to come to.

### 1-day Hands-on Workshop
A hands-on, practical workshop for a group of 5-20 people. I will take you through the main exercises in the book, in-person. Together, we'll help you get your shit together and make some decisions about your money. Ideal for workplaces, or just get your friends together. Cost varies, just get in touch and we can chat about it.

### School Talks: Everything You Need to Know About Money
A 60 minute talk aimed at high school students that takes them through all the basics of money management. I promise to try very hard not to swear.
**R5,000** for government schools. **R20,000** for private schools. If your school really can't afford it, I will do it for free (you'll just need to pay for my travel costs).
