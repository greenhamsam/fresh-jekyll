## Want to leave us a comment? Rad! Here are the rules.

**ANYTHING YOU READ ON THIS SITE, SPECIFICALLY IN THE COMMENTS, SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL ADVICE. Talk to a licensed FSP if you need to.**

WE WANT THIS COMMUNITY TO BE A PLACE THAT IS HELPFUL, RESPECTFUL, AND FILLED WITH KIFFVIBES. Unfortunately, this is not the natural tendency of online communities, so we need some rules.

1. THIS IS A NO JUDGEMENT ZONE. Everyone spends money differently. Everyone has their own money blind spots, goals, and contextual needs that you don’t understand. The fastest way to get your comments deleted is to say anything judgemental about how someone else chooses to spend their money or to live their life. Give advice about where someone else can cut their spending only if they ask you to.

2. HATE THE GAME, NOT THE PLAYA. Late Capitalism is a fucked up system and we live in a profoundly unequal world. Some people in this system are much poorer than you, and some are much richer. You’re not allowed to denigrate or insult people for wherever they happen to sit on this wealth ladder. The poor are not poor because they are lazy or stupid. The rich are not rich because they are immoral or ruthless. Don’t shame people for being richer or poorer than you are, but by all means go ahead and rant about how the system that creates such inequality is bullshit.

3. DON’T BE AN ASSHOLE. That means no sexism, no racism, no ableism, no ageism, no homophobia, no shaming of mental health issues, just no kakvibes, people. Anything that looks like a personal attack or an attack on someone’s identity will get you banned quicker than you can spit. Remember that there is a human being on the other side of your keyboard. Be nice.

4. STAY ON TOPIC. This is a community for sharing advice about money management, saving, investing, getting out of debt, and earning more money (and also jokes about these things). Don’t get too far off-topic.

5. BAD ADVICE MAY BE DELETED. There’s a lot of reasonable debate about smart things to do with your money, and debating these different approaches is completely encouraged! But there’s also some advice that is just plain wrong, and it will be flagged as such to protect the community. Specifically, we do not believe in pyramid schemes, multilevel marketing, automated forex trading or general “get rich quick” nonsense. Don’t post that shit here.

6. NO DRAMA BAITING. Don’t go looking to pick fights or start shit. This isn’t a thunderdome.

7. THIS IS A PROFANITY-FRIENDLY SPACE. If that makes you uncomfortable, then this is not the community for you.

8. SAM'S WORD IS LAW. Ultimately, I'm going to kick you out if you’re making the vibes miff instead of kiff. That's not democratic, but it's the only way I know of to keep things civil for everybody.
