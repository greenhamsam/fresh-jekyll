## Like a Fucking Grownup - the podcast!

Do you feel like you’re just faking knowing how to adult? Me too! No-one gave us a guide to any of this stuff. This is a show where we take all the big scary questions you’ve always felt too embarrassed to ask, and try to find solutions.

_Like a Fucking Grownup_ is a new podcast about health, money, happiness, and how to live our best lives, for people who have noooo idea what they're doing.
