# Meet Sam Beckbessinger

<img src="images/sambeckbessinger.jpg" alt="Sam Beckbessinger" style="max-width:200px;margin:20px" align="right">

Hi. I'm Sam. I'm a writer, UX researcher and fintech entrepreneur whoâ€™s spent most of the past ten years building tools to help people manage their money better. I also write fiction (mostly weird horror stuff featuring too many bodily fluids). I live in Cape Town, South Africa, with my stupid cat Sir Digby Chicken Caesar.

**VERY IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: I am not a certified financial advisor. I want to help you understand some money basics, and show you a path to sorting your financial life out. If your situation is complicated, [get some professional help]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-06-16-get-some-advice.md %}).**

You can learn more about me over on my [personal website](https://sambeckbessinger.com).
