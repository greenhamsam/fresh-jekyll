# Meet Sam

Howzit. I’m Sam. I’ve spent most of the past decade trying to build better tools for interacting with money, and now I own a fintech consultancy. I didn’t do this because I find money particularly interesting. Money, as you’ll see, is actually pretty basic. What I find fascinating is humans, and the choices they make about what kind of lives to live, and the stories we tell each other about how the world works.

This has involved countless hours interviewing people about what they want from money, from South Africa to Kenya, Uganda to London, Zimbabwe to San Francisco. People have told me their money plans, their hopes and dreams, their fears and their feels.

Do you know what I learnt? The stories we’re told about money are mostly bullshit.

We never get an instruction manual about how money works. We never have to pass a test to get our Money License before we can take a new credit card for a drive. Most of what we learn about money comes from advertising or from other people who know as little as we do. No wonder we make such basic mistakes. No wonder we feel disempowered and scared. No wonder so many of us just decide to stick our heads in the damn sand and just never deal with it.

I decided to start this community, because so many of the people I spoke to told me that they wished someone would.

The last thing you should know about me: I have a potty mouth. Don’t blame me, blame my mother - who swears like a sailor. The second word I ever learned was the word “fuck”.

Also, I once high-fived Barack Obama (true story).
