Interested in investigating some innovative ways to get an education? Not sure the traditional (and expensive) university track is for you? Here are some alternatives you could consider.

## TVET/FET colleges
The number of people enrolling at FET colleges is still tiny compared to university applicants throughout the country. That's a pity, because this country needs a lot more hands-on practical skills!

[Here's a full list of all the TVET colleges in South Africa](http://www.tvetcolleges.co.za/default.aspx)
If that one's down, try [this one](http://7sundays.co.za/KeepClimbing/2017/01/07/list-of-all-public-tvet-colleges/)

## Software schools
Africa's going to need a lot more people who know how to code to save us once the robot uprising happens. There are some really great, new-style practical coding schools popping up around the country who want to teach young people these skills, and some of them are even free.

- [CodeX](http://www.projectcodex.co/)

## Creative schools
There are some great school alternatives that focus on developing creative skills. Unfortunately, most of these courses are hella expensive (like, more than traditional varsity). Hit me up in the comments if you've got any tips for more cost-effective alternatives.
