In the Western Cape, there are six FET colleges, namely, College of Cape Town, False Bay College, Northlink College, West Coast College, Boland College and South Cape College. These colleges are spread out over 35 campuses around the province with an estimated 15-20000 students currently enrolled. If the numbers from UJ are anything to go by, the numbers enrolling at FET colleges are still tiny compared to university applicants (regardless of acceptance) throughout the country.
