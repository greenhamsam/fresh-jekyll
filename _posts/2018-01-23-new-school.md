## TVET/FET colleges
The number of people enrolling at FET colleges is still tiny compared to university applicants throughout the country. That's a pity, because this country needs a lot more hands-on practical skills!

[Here's a full list of all the TVET colleges in South Africa](http://www.tvetcolleges.co.za/default.aspx)
If that one's down, try [this one](http://7sundays.co.za/KeepClimbing/2017/01/07/list-of-all-public-tvet-colleges/)

Some particular TVET colleges that have been recommended by people we know include:
- [Sparrow FET College](http://www.sparrowschools.co.za/fet_college.html)

## Technical and vocational skills programmes

[Learn to Earn](https://www.learntoearn.org.za/index.php/training/our-courses/course-overview-fees) is a non-profit organisation that runs very affordable short courses in Khayelitsha and Hermanus for unemployed people, covering skills ranging from sewing to graphic design to woodwork. 83% of their graduates become economically active after completing the courses.

[JumpStart](http://www.mrpfoundation.org/Our-Focus-Skills.aspx) is run by the Mr Price foundation and runs skills development programmes in KZN.

[Harambee](http://harambee.co.za/) is an excellent resource that helps young, unemployed people find entry-level jobs, many of which offer on-the-job training.

## Software schools
Africa's going to need a lot more people who know how to code to save us once the robot uprising happens. There are some really great, new-style practical coding schools popping up around the country who want to teach young people these skills, and some of them are even free.

- [We Think Code](https://www.wethinkcode.co.za/)
- [Explore Data Science Academy](https://www.explore-datascience.net/)
- [CodeX](http://www.projectcodex.co/)

## Creative schools
There are some great school alternatives that focus on developing creative skills. Unfortunately, most of these courses are hella expensive (like, more than traditional varsity).

One exception is [Umuzi](http://umuzi.org/learnership/), which is a 12 month paid learnership.

Other (expensive) options include:
- [AFDA](https://www.afda.co.za/)
- [Friends of Design](http://friendsofdesign.net/)
- [Red&Yellow](https://www.redandyellow.co.za/)
- [Vega](https://www.vegaschool.com/Pages/default.aspx)
- [Cape Town Creative Academy](http://ctca.co.za/)
- [CityVarsity](https://www.cityvarsity.co.za/)
- [BHC School of Design](http://www.designschool.co.za/)

Hit me up in the comments if you've got any tips for more cost-effective alternatives.
