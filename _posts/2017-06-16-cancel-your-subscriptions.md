I love you and I want you to be happy, so here are a list of subscriptions that are probably wasting your money. Cancel them and rather spend your cash on adventures and donations to charity and other shit that might actually make your life better.

| Subscription | Phone | Email | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|-------|-------|
| DStv | (011) 289 2222 | https://selfservice.dstv.com/contact-us | Think they let you cancel online? Ha! No chance. |
| Vodacom | 082 111 |  | Follow the prompts for "Contract queries", then "Cancellations" |
| MTN |  | retentions@MTN.co.za | Email them and ask for a cancellations quote |
| Cell C | 084 143 |  | Dial "2" for cancellations |
| Telkom | 081 180 |  | Talk to the operator and ask for a cancellation quote |
| Virgin Active | 0860 200 911 |  | They also have a temporary contract freeze option if you prefer |

Got any others to suggest? Let me know so I can keep the table up to date for ya.
