_Heyyyyyyy... remember how I'm not a professional, qualified financial adviser? Just reminding you of that fact. Do your own homework before you put your money in something and [talk to an actual financial adviser]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-06-16-get-some-advice.md %}) if you need to. Kthnxbai._

Guys, there are a lot of different accounts and funds out there, and I'm not listing every single one of them here. These are just some of the funds that I've personally scouted out as potential candidates for my own portfolio.

(Psst: if you do want a pretty comprehensive list of funds in South Africa, try [this link.](http://www.fundsdata.co.za/navs/default.htm))

I like to choose things that:
- Have the **lowest possible costs** (look for the "total expense ratio") - this almost always means passive index investing. You should read chapter 7 of the book for the full debate on active vs. passive funds and make up your own mind about this.
- Are with **reputable, legit companies** that won't vanish with my money.
- Are friendly for people who like to **handle their investments themselves, online** because, come on, it's 2018.

Of course, you need to choose the right type of fund, with the right asset allocation, for your time period, which will tell you what your risk appetite should be. The basic rule for this is that the sooner you want to spend that chunk money, the lower the risk rating you're looking for.

New funds come out all the time! And I'm also not a wizard, so I might have missed some really great options. If you've found a fund that you think is hella-mega-cool, let me know about it so that we can keep building this list.

Don't get too excited about those interest rates from Absa and Standard Bank - they have different interest tiers depending on how much money you have saved, and those are the maximums, often requiring you to have a few million in the account.

You can actually just buy individual stocks, and some good global ETFs, on Easy Equities now. Only on the NYSE I think.
