Here are the cheapest places I've found to buy the things you really do need to buy. Tell me about your own ideas in the comments, and I'll go investigate!

# Glasses
Blind as a bat, like me? Glasses are ridiculously expensive, and for no good reason. I mean really, it's two pieces of glass held together by a bit of metal or plastic, why should it cost thousands of rands? The truth is that most of what you're paying for is brand, and the fact that the glasses industry, internationally, is a crazy monopoly and a crock of shit.

Local online store, Eye Cafe, lets you email them your prescription (which you can get very cheaply at any optometrist or physical glasses store) and then they will ship glasses or prescription sunglasses to you in a couple of weeks. They're cheap, and pretty good quality. Prices start at R490, including the lenses, frames, the whole shebang. I've been rocking glasses from them for years now.
