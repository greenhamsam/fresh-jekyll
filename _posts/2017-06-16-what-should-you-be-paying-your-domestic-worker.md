Guys, seriously, this is not the place to be frugal about your budget.

Also, remember that you have responsibilities to your employees that go beyond just paying them. There's a [helpful document](http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/downloads/documents/useful-documents/basic-conditions-of-employment/domesticworker2012.pdf) on the Department of Labour's website that will tell you more about the relevant laws and guidelines that you need to know about.
