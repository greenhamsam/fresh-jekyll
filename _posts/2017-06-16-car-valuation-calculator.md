Your car is a money bonfire. Trade that thing in for a bicycle or a cheap-ass rustbucket or a pair of sequined fairy wings and save yourself a goddamned fortune.

How much is your car actually worth if you sell it? [Here's an app](https://www.firstcheck.co.za/) that will tell you. You can also use [Transunion's online car value report](https://www.transunion.co.za/product/car-value-report) tool, which will cost you the GOBSMACKING FEE of R10.

Once you know how much you can realistically get for your car, use the calculator on the Money Dashboard to work out how much you could save by selling your car and relying on public transport or Uber.
