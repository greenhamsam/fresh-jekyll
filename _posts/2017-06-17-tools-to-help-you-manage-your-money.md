It’s really important that you can check, at any moment:
1. The current balances of any of your debts, accounts or investments
2. All of your transactions.

And you’ve got to have real data! If you just try to rely on your memory and guesses, you’ll be off by half.

So, find an automated app that will gather all your money information for you and keep it all up to date without your having to do anything. There are many of these apps out there. You want to find one that:
1. Is very secure
2. Supports South African accounts (duh)
3. Tracks more than just bank accounts (store cards, investments, everything)
4. Updates all your stuff automatically
5. Is easy to use

There are some apps that need you to do this manually (hell, you could even do this in a spreadsheet), but don’t waste your time with them. Life's too short to track every single transaction you make.

I'm biased because I used to work at 22seven, but I legit think it's the most awesome product for South Africans. But take a look at your alternatives and find something that works for you!

The Capitec app is pretty good for day to day budgeting, but you can't keep track of other things (like your investments or debts) with it. It's pretty good if you're starting out and already bank with Capitec, though.
