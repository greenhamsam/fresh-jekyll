It might sound unromantic, but learning how to talk about money in your relationship is one of the most important things you can do to keep your love alive, because money problems are one of the most common reasons for divorce.

Money touches all of our fears, our insecurities, our hopes and our values. So here’s an exercise to help you get onto the same page: a list of money questions for you and your partner.

Put aside an evening, make your favourite dinner, and spend some time independently writing down your answers to these questions. When you’re done, swop answers and read what your partner wrote. These questions will ask you to think about your financial goals, beliefs and worries, and learn about theirs.

Depending on where you are in your relationship, you might want to skip some of these questions. Agree which ones you want to answer before you begin.

It's important to go into this exercise with love, patience and empathy for each other. Remember, this exercise is mostly about **learning about your partner**, not just convincing them of your point of view.
