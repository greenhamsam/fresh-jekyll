Now, real life is never simple or linear, so don't expect your life to track these steps perfectly, either! Think of it like a map: it's really helpful to have a rough idea of where to go, but the really interesting stuff happens in the little unplanned detours you might take along the way.

This flowchart is yours to download, print and share as you wish.
