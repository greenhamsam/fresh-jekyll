Shock! Horror! There's a tiny mistake in the OTHERWISE 100% PERFECT book!
<!--more-->

On page 77, you'll find this graph comparing the impact on your net worth of taking R1000 out of savings vs. taking a loan for it. I'm a moron and I switched the key around. The RED bars show you what happens if you pull the money out of savings, and the BLACK bars show you what happens if you take a loan for the money. The X-axis compares how long you take to pay back the money.

Woops. Sorry.
